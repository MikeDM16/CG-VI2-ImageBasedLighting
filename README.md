# Image-based lighting with Embree: Performance and convergence times

Computer Vision - Visão e Iluminação II

Some project keypoints:
- At the time of this project, Intel Embree doesn't support image-based lighting techniques. The goal of this project is then to implement a set of class that allows working with this kind of environment lighting

- Analysis of performance times and convergence rates

- Technique improvements using importance sampling
